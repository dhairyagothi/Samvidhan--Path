# Article 35 of the Constitution of India

Article 35 of the Constitution of India grants the **Parliament of India** the exclusive authority to make laws related to specific provisions that modify, restrict, or implement certain fundamental rights and their application. It centralizes the power to legislate on matters that are important for the administration of justice and the protection of fundamental rights in India. This article is crucial in ensuring consistency and uniformity in the implementation of these rights across the country.

## Text of Article 35

> Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution:
> 
> (a) **Parliament shall have, and the Legislature of a State shall not have, power to make laws—**
> 
> (i) with respect to any of the matters which under clause (3) of Article 16, clause (3) of Article 32, Article 33, and Article 34 may be provided for by law made by Parliament; and  
> (ii) for prescribing punishment for those acts which are declared to be offences under this Part, and Parliament shall, as soon as may be after the commencement of this Constitution, make laws for prescribing punishment for the acts referred to in sub-clause (ii).
> 
> (b) any law in force immediately before the commencement of this Constitution in the territory of India with respect to any of the matters referred to in sub-clause (i) or providing for punishment as mentioned in sub-clause (ii) shall, subject to the terms thereof and to any adaptations and modifications that may be made therein under Article 372, continue in force until altered or repealed or amended by Parliament.

## Importance of Article 35

### 1. **Centralized Legislative Power**
Article 35 centralizes legislative power by exclusively granting **Parliament** the authority to make laws for specific issues related to fundamental rights. This ensures that any restrictions, modifications, or penalties related to these rights are uniform across the country. This avoids discrepancies or conflicting laws that could arise if state legislatures had the power to legislate on such matters.

### 2. **Uniformity in Implementation of Fundamental Rights**
By empowering only Parliament to legislate on key aspects such as punishment for offenses related to fundamental rights (e.g., untouchability or forced labor), Article 35 ensures that these rights are implemented consistently across all states in India. It guarantees that no state can create divergent laws or practices that would infringe upon fundamental rights as enshrined in the Constitution.

### 3. **Enabling Restrictions for Specific Groups**
Article 35 empowers Parliament to make laws that can restrict or modify fundamental rights for specific groups, such as members of the armed forces. This is particularly relevant in matters like **Article 33**, which allows the Parliament to impose reasonable restrictions on the fundamental rights of military personnel for the better performance of their duties. Similarly, Article 34 allows Parliament to regulate rights during a state of emergency or martial law.

### 4. **Continuation of Pre-Constitutional Laws**
In cases where laws were in force prior to the adoption of the Constitution (especially those related to fundamental rights or their restrictions), Article 35 allows these laws to continue in force unless specifically altered, amended, or repealed by Parliament. This provision ensures a smooth transition and maintains legal continuity from the pre-Constitution period.

## Example

### Case Study: **Laws Relating to Fundamental Rights and the Armed Forces**

* **Application of Article 33:**  
  The Constitution provides that Parliament may legislate on matters concerning the application of fundamental rights to members of the armed forces. For example, laws can be enacted that limit certain freedoms like the freedom of speech or the right to form associations to maintain discipline within the military. These laws are crafted by Parliament and are essential to the effective functioning of the armed forces, ensuring national security.

* **Punishment for Offenses (Article 35 Sub-Clause (ii)):**  
  Article 35 also enables Parliament to prescribe punishments for acts that are violations of fundamental rights. For example, under the **Untouchability Offenses Act**, Parliament has legislated severe punishments for those practicing untouchability, which is a direct violation of the fundamental right to equality guaranteed by **Article 17**. Similarly, the law to punish forced labor (Article 23) is another example of Parliament exercising its power under Article 35.

### 5. **Preserving Constitutional Integrity**
Article 35 serves to safeguard the integrity of the Constitution by ensuring that Parliament remains the sole body to legislate on fundamental rights and their application. It prevents individual states from making contradictory laws that could undermine the protections afforded by the Constitution.

### Note:
Article 35’s purpose is to centralize the power of making laws related to fundamental rights, with specific focus on uniform application, especially for the armed forces and during extraordinary circumstances like an emergency. It also allows Parliament to prescribe punishment for violations of certain rights, providing clarity and continuity in legal processes.
