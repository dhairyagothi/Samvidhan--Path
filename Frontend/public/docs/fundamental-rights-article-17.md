## Legal Framework to Enforce Article 17

To implement Article 17 effectively, the Indian Parliament enacted the following laws:

### **1. Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 (Originally Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955):**  
   This Act makes the practice of untouchability a punishable offence. Key provisions include:  
   - Prohibition of denial of access to public places like wells, roads, and temples.  
   - Penalties for enforcing disabilities based on untouchability, including imprisonment and fines.  
   - Empowerment of authorities to ensure compliance.

### **2. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989:**  
   This law strengthens protections for SCs and STs against untouchability and other atrocities. It ensures fast-track justice, stringent punishments, and rehabilitation measures for victims.

## Judicial Interpretation

The judiciary has played a pivotal role in reinforcing Article 17:

### **1. State of Karnataka v. Appa Balu Ingale (1993):**  
   The Supreme Court ruled that the practice of untouchability violates Article 17 and cannot be justified on any grounds, including religion or custom.

### **2. PUDR v. Union of India (1982):**  
   The Court emphasized that forced labor, arising from untouchability or caste discrimination, violates the principles of equality and dignity.

### **3. N. Adithayan v. Travancore Devaswom Board (2002):**  
   The Court held that any denial of temple entry to specific communities based on caste amounts to untouchability and is unconstitutional.

## Examples

### Case Study 1: **Denial of Public Facilities**  
   Denying access to public wells or temples to members of Scheduled Castes is a violation of Article 17. Such actions can lead to prosecution under the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955.

### Case Study 2: **Caste-Based Discrimination in Schools**  
   Instances where children are segregated during midday meals based on caste, or denied equal treatment in educational institutions, constitute a breach of Article 17. Authorities are mandated to take legal action against such practices.

### Case Study 3: **Social Boycotts and Untouchability Practices**  
   Imposing social boycotts or barring individuals from participating in village or community activities due to their caste falls under the ambit of untouchability and can be penalized under existing laws.
