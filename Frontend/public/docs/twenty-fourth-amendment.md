# Twenty-Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India

The **Twenty-Fourth Amendment** to the Constitution of India was enacted in 1971. It reaffirmed the authority of Parliament to amend the Constitution, including the provisions related to Fundamental Rights, following the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case.

## Key Features of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment

1. **Reaffirmation of Parliamentary Power:**  
   - Amended **Article 368** to explicitly state that Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights.  
   - Made it mandatory for the President to give assent to any Constitutional Amendment Bill passed by Parliament.

2. **Amendment to Article 13:**  
   - Inserted a clause clarifying that **Article 13** (which protects Fundamental Rights from laws inconsistent with them) does not apply to amendments made under Article 368.

3. **Constitutional Supremacy:**  
   - Affirmed the supremacy of Parliament in matters of constitutional amendment, ensuring that amendments are not subject to the constraints applicable to ordinary laws.

## Importance of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment

1. **Clarification of Amending Power:**  
   The amendment resolved ambiguities regarding the scope of Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution, particularly Fundamental Rights, as raised by judicial interpretations.

2. **Presidential Assent:**  
   By making Presidential assent mandatory for Constitutional Amendment Bills, it eliminated any potential delay in the enactment of such amendments.

3. **Strengthening Legislative Authority:**  
   It empowered Parliament to make necessary changes to the Constitution to adapt to evolving socio-political needs.

## Example of Application

1. **Judicial Scrutiny and Kesavananda Bharati Case:**  
   The amendment was a response to earlier judicial pronouncements, particularly in the **Golak Nath case**, which limited Parliament’s power to amend Fundamental Rights.

2. **Subsequent Amendments:**  
   The Twenty-Fourth Amendment paved the way for subsequent amendments, such as the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, that sought to implement social and economic reforms.
