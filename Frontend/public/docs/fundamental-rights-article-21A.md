# **Article 21A: Right to Education**

Article 21A was inserted into the Indian Constitution by the **86th Amendment Act of 2002**. It guarantees the right to free and compulsory education for children in the age group of 6 to 14 years. This right was added to ensure that all children have access to education, contributing to the goal of making India a more educated and equitable society.

> "The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine."

### **Key Provisions**

---

## **1. Right to Free and Compulsory Education**

### **Explanation**:
Article 21A makes it the responsibility of the **State** to provide free and compulsory education to children between the ages of 6 and 14 years. This means that every child, regardless of socio-economic background, is entitled to an education without any financial burden.

The state is required to make provisions for education that are accessible and affordable for all children in this age group. 

### **Example**:
In **Unnikrishnan J.P. v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1993)**, the Supreme Court held that the right to education is a fundamental right under Article 21, even before the insertion of Article 21A. However, it is only after the **86th Amendment Act of 2002** that this right was explicitly included as a fundamental right, ensuring that it is now enforceable by law.

## **2. Compulsory Education**

### **Explanation**:
The term "compulsory" means that the state must ensure that children in this age group attend school. Parents and guardians are also under an obligation to ensure that their children attend school, and the state must take all necessary measures to remove barriers to education.

### **Example**:
The **Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act)**, which was enacted following the insertion of Article 21A, outlines detailed provisions for the implementation of this right. It mandates that no child shall be denied admission to school, and no child shall be subjected to any form of discrimination in the educational environment.

## **3. Legal Framework for Implementation**

### **Explanation**:
Article 21A requires the state to make laws that govern the manner in which free and compulsory education is provided. The **RTE Act** specifies the norms for the quality of education, teacher qualifications, infrastructure, and other necessary resources. It also requires the establishment of proper grievance redressal mechanisms for the children or their families.

### **Example**:
Under the **RTE Act**, schools are required to admit children without any admission tests, fees, or donations. It also mandates that the curriculum should be child-friendly and relevant to the child's age and developmental needs. The government must also ensure that adequate infrastructure, such as classrooms, toilets, and play areas, is provided to ensure a safe learning environment.

## **4. Role of the State**

### **Explanation**:
The responsibility for the implementation of the right to education lies with the state, which is required to take positive action to make education accessible. This includes establishing schools, appointing teachers, and ensuring that children from disadvantaged backgrounds are provided with the opportunity to attend school.

### **Example**:
In **Mohini Jain v. State of Karnataka (1992)**, the Supreme Court ruled that education should be made available to all children as a basic human right. Following this ruling, various state governments took action to implement the right to education in a structured manner, with a particular focus on primary education.

### **Importance of Article 21A**

Article 21A holds significant importance as it marks a crucial step towards ensuring **universal education** in India. It reflects the state's commitment to creating an inclusive society where children, irrespective of their socio-economic background, have the opportunity to receive quality education. The law aims to provide every child with the foundation necessary for personal development, societal participation, and economic contribution.

This right is pivotal for breaking the cycle of poverty and promoting **social mobility**, as education opens up opportunities for individuals to improve their socio-economic conditions. The implementation of this right is crucial for the overall growth of the nation, as an educated population contributes to the countryâ€™s economic and social progress.
