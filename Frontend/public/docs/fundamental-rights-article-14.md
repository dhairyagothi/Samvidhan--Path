# Article 14 of the Constitution of India

Article 14 of the Constitution of India guarantees the **"Right to Equality"** to all citizens of India. It reads as follows:

> "The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India."

## Importance of Article 14

**1. Equality Before the Law:**  
This concept originates from the English Common Law and implies the absence of any special privilege in favor of individuals. All persons, regardless of their status or position, are subject to the same laws and are equally accountable for any violations.

**2. Equal Protection of the Laws:**  
This concept is borrowed from the American Constitution and mandates that equal treatment must be provided to individuals who are similarly situated. It emphasizes the substantive aspect of equality by ensuring fairness in the law's application.

## Applicability of Article 14

Article 14 applies to both **citizens and non-citizens** within the territory of India. It ensures that no person is discriminated against by the State solely based on arbitrary classifications.

### Key Principles:

* **Rule of Law:**  
  Article 14 upholds the fundamental principle of the rule of law, ensuring that every individual is subject to the same laws and has equal protection under them.

* **Reasonable Classification:**  
  While Article 14 prohibits arbitrary discrimination, it allows for **reasonable classification** based on intelligible differentia and a rational nexus with the objective sought to be achieved. For example, tax laws may classify individuals based on income levels.

## Example

### Case Study: **Equality in Public Employment**

Article 14 is often invoked in cases of discrimination in public employment. For instance, if a government job vacancy discriminates against candidates based solely on gender, caste, or religion, such discrimination can be challenged under Article 14.

* **Example:**  
  If a public-sector job posting excludes candidates from a specific region without valid reasoning, such exclusion can be challenged as violating the principle of equality under Article 14.

## Judicial Interpretation

The judiciary has played a significant role in interpreting Article 14 to ensure it remains dynamic and responsive to societal needs. Some landmark judgments include:

* **Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978):**  
  The Supreme Court held that Article 14, along with Articles 19 and 21, forms the golden triangle of the Constitution, ensuring justice, equality, and liberty.

* **State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar (1952):**  
  The Court ruled that any classification made under law must be reasonable and not arbitrary.
