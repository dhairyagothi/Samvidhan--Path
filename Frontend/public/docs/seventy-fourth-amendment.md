# Seventy-Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India

The **Seventy-Fourth Amendment** to the Constitution of India, enacted in 1992, provided a constitutional framework for **urban local self-governance** through the establishment of **Municipalities**. This amendment added **Part IXA** to the Constitution and introduced the **Twelfth Schedule**, specifying the functional areas of Municipalities.

## Key Features of the Seventy-Fourth Amendment

1. **Establishment of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs):**  
   - Mandated the creation of three types of Municipalities based on population size:  
     - **Nagar Panchayats** for transitioning rural to urban areas.  
     - **Municipal Councils** for smaller urban areas.  
     - **Municipal Corporations** for larger urban areas.

2. **Reservation of Seats:**  
   - Provided for the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and women (not less than one-third of the total seats) in all ULBs.

3. **Regular Elections:**  
   - Ensured that elections to Municipalities are held every five years.  
   - Mandated the establishment of a **State Election Commission** to oversee the elections.

4. **Devolution of Powers and Responsibilities:**  
   - Added the **Twelfth Schedule**, listing 18 subjects on which Municipalities can function, such as urban planning, water supply, sanitation, public health, and slum improvement.

5. **State Finance Commission:**  
   - Directed the establishment of a State Finance Commission every five years to recommend the distribution of financial resources between the State and Municipalities.

6. **Ward Committees:**  
   - Mandated the creation of **Ward Committees** in Municipalities with a population of 300,000 or more to ensure local participation in governance.

## Importance of the Seventy-Fourth Amendment

1. **Democratic Urban Governance:**  
   It institutionalized Municipalities as the third tier of governance, empowering them to manage urban affairs.

2. **Inclusion and Empowerment:**  
   The reservation of seats for women, SCs, and STs promoted inclusive urban governance and representation.

3. **Urban Development:**  
   The Twelfth Schedule enabled Municipalities to plan and implement programs for urban development and address local issues effectively.

## Example of Application

1. **Urban Development Projects:**  
   Municipalities have been instrumental in implementing programs like the **Smart Cities Mission** and **Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT)**.

2. **Local Participation:**  
   Ward Committees and elected representatives ensure grassroots participation in decision-making for urban planning and infrastructure.
