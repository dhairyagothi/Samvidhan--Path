# Article 34 of the Constitution of India

Article 34 of the Constitution of India provides special powers to Parliament to enact laws restricting fundamental rights while martial law is in force in any area. This ensures the security and stability of the nation during extraordinary circumstances.

## Text of Article 34

> Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Part, Parliament may by law indemnify:  
> (a) any person in the service of the Union or of a State or any other person in respect of any act done by him in connection with the maintenance or restoration of order in any area where martial law was in force; and  
> (b) any such law may validate any sentence passed, punishment inflicted, forfeiture ordered, or other act done under martial law in such area.

## Importance of Article 34

**1. Ensures Accountability During Martial Law:**  
Article 34 allows Parliament to indemnify individuals, including armed forces personnel, for actions taken in good faith during martial law, preventing unnecessary litigation.

**2. Restores Order in Disturbed Areas:**  
By validating actions taken under martial law, Article 34 facilitates the maintenance or restoration of public order in regions affected by extreme unrest or conflict.

**3. Balance Between Rights and Security:**  
While limiting certain fundamental rights temporarily, the provision ensures that such measures are legally backed and subjected to parliamentary oversight.

## Example

### Case Study: **Indemnity During Martial Law**

During situations where martial law is declared, actions such as curfews, restrictions on movement, or arrests without regular judicial procedures may be necessary. For example:

* **Indemnification of Actions:**  
  Security personnel who take measures to restore peace in areas under martial law are indemnified against legal proceedings, provided these actions were taken in good faith.

* **Validation of Punishments:**  
  Punishments or sentences imposed by martial law authorities are validated through laws enacted by Parliament under Article 34.

### Note:

Article 34 operates under extraordinary circumstances and does not grant unchecked powers. The imposition of martial law itself must align with constitutional provisions, and Parliament retains the authority to oversee and validate actions.
