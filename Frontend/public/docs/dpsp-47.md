## Judicial Interpretation

Article 47, being a **Directive Principle of State Policy**, is not enforceable by the courts. However, the judiciary has played a role in interpreting and upholding its principles. Several landmark cases have focused on the need to improve public health and curb the consumption of harmful substances.

### Landmark Cases:

## Modern Relevance

The relevance of Article 47 continues to grow in modern India due to challenges related to public health, nutrition, and the widespread abuse of intoxicants. The rise of **non-communicable diseases** such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, coupled with issues like **malnutrition** and **substance abuse**, calls for stronger and more effective action from the State.

### Key Areas for Improvement:

1. **Access to Affordable Healthcare:**  
   While India has made significant strides in improving public health, there is still a need for more accessible and affordable healthcare services, particularly for marginalized communities. Ensuring that every citizen has access to **basic healthcare** services is critical.

2. **Fight Against Substance Abuse:**  
   Prohibition and regulation of **alcohol**, **tobacco**, and **drugs** should be reinforced through strict implementation of laws, awareness campaigns, and rehabilitation programs.
