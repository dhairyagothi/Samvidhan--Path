Article 13 of the Constitution of India lays down the framework for ensuring that laws do not infringe upon the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution. It specifically addresses the interplay between existing laws, future laws, and the Constitution.

## Key Provisions of Article 13

According to Article 13:

1. **Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights:**  
   > All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.

2. **Power of the State to make laws:**  
   > The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part, and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.

3. **Definition of "law":**  
   Article 13 clarifies that the term "law" includes:
   - Ordinances, orders, bye-laws, rules, regulations, notifications, customs, or usages having the force of law.
   - This ensures that fundamental rights are protected against violations through statutory and non-statutory means.

4. **Judicial Review:**  
   The article establishes the concept of judicial review, empowering the courts to invalidate laws that are inconsistent with fundamental rights.

## Importance of Article 13

1. **Protection of Fundamental Rights:**  
   Article 13 ensures that no law, policy, or custom can infringe upon the fundamental rights of individuals.

2. **Judicial Safeguard:**  
   It provides the judiciary with the authority to examine the constitutionality of laws and uphold the supremacy of the Constitution.

## Examples

### Case Study: **Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)**  
In this landmark case, the Supreme Court of India reaffirmed that the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution are sacrosanct, and any law infringing upon them is subject to judicial review under Article 13.

### Note:

- Article 13 serves as the foundation for judicial activism in India, enabling the courts to protect individual rights.
- It does not apply to constitutional amendments made under Article 368, as clarified in the Kesavananda Bharati case.
