# Case Study: **Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)**

## **Background**
The **Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)** case is a cornerstone of Indian constitutional law, renowned for establishing the **Basic Structure Doctrine**, which limits Parliament's power to amend the Constitution. The case was brought under **Article 51A(a)**, emphasizing the duty to uphold and protect the Constitution.

In this case, Swami Kesavananda Bharati, the head of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala government's attempts to impose land reforms that infringed upon his Mutt’s property rights. The case evolved into a landmark constitutional debate, addressing the scope of **Parliament’s amending powers** under **Article 368**.

### **Case History**
1. **Context**: The **24th, 25th, and 29th Constitutional Amendments** were enacted to enable Parliament to curtail property rights and implement socio-economic reforms. These amendments raised concerns about the erosion of fundamental rights and the balance of power between the judiciary and the legislature.
   
2. **Legal Challenge**:
   - Swami Kesavananda Bharati invoked **Article 26**, claiming that the land reforms violated the Mutt’s right to manage its religious property.
   - The case expanded to question whether Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution, including **Fundamental Rights**.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - Does Parliament have unlimited power to amend the Constitution under Article 368?
   - Can the amendment process alter the **basic structure** of the Constitution?
