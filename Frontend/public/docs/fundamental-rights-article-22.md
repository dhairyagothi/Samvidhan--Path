# **Article 22: Protection Against Arrest and Detention in Certain Cases**

Article 22 of the Indian Constitution provides protection against arbitrary arrest and detention, ensuring that individuals are not deprived of their liberty without a fair process. This protection applies in certain cases where an individual is arrested or detained under specific legal provisions.

> "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law."

### **Key Provisions**

## **1. Right to be Informed of Reasons for Arrest**

### **Explanation**:
Article 22(1) mandates that a person who is arrested must be informed of the reasons for their arrest and should be allowed to consult a legal practitioner of their choice. This ensures transparency and accountability in the process of arrest, preventing arbitrary detention.

### **Example**:
In the case of **D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal (1997)**, the Supreme Court outlined the procedure to be followed when an individual is arrested. The guidelines stipulated that the arrested person must be informed of the reasons for their arrest and must be given access to a lawyer.

## **2. Right to be Produced Before a Magistrate**

### **Explanation**:
Article 22(2) ensures that an arrested individual must be brought before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest. This provision prevents prolonged and unlawful detention, providing a safeguard against the abuse of power by law enforcement agencies.

### **Example**:
In **Khatri v. State of Bihar (1981)**, the Supreme Court emphasized that any delay in producing an arrested person before a magistrate is unconstitutional, violating the protection provided under Article 22.

## **3. Preventive Detention**

### **Explanation**:
Article 22 allows for preventive detention, where a person can be detained without trial if there is a reasonable suspicion that their actions could harm national security or public order. However, preventive detention is subject to certain safeguards, including review by an Advisory Board.

### **Example**:
In **A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras (1950)**, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of preventive detention laws but also reinforced that the detained person must be informed of the reasons for their detention and given the opportunity to challenge it.

## **4. Preventive Detention Beyond Three Months**

### **Explanation**:
Article 22(4) and (5) set a limit on the duration of preventive detention without trial. A person cannot be detained beyond three months without the approval of an Advisory Board, ensuring that preventive detention is not used arbitrarily.

### **Example**:
In **Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978)**, the Court ruled that preventive detention laws must comply with the requirements of Article 22, which include judicial review to prevent any misuse of power.

### **Importance of Article 22**

Article 22 ensures that the right to liberty is not arbitrarily denied by the state. It provides safeguards for individuals against wrongful arrest and detention, while also balancing the need for preventive action in cases of national security or public order. The protection against unlawful detention strengthens the integrity of the justice system, ensuring that individuals are not deprived of their rights without a fair legal process.
