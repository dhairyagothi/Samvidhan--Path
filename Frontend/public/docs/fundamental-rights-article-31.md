# Article 31 of the Constitution of India

**Note:** Article 31 of the Constitution of India, which dealt with the **Right to Property**, was repealed by the **44th Amendment Act, 1978**. The Right to Property is no longer a fundamental right but has been retained as a constitutional right under Article 300A in Part XII of the Constitution.

## Historical Context of Article 31

Before its repeal, Article 31 guaranteed that no person could be deprived of their property except by authority of law and laid down provisions regarding compensation for the acquisition of private property by the state. The article aimed to strike a balance between individual property rights and the state's power to acquire property for public purposes.

## Key Provisions of Article 31 (Now Repealed)

1. **Protection Against Arbitrary Deprivation:**  
   Article 31 stated that no person could be deprived of their property except by a law that clearly provided for such deprivation.

2. **Compensation for Acquisition:**  
   If the government acquired private property for public purposes, it was required to pay compensation, ensuring fairness to the property owner.

## Reasons for Repeal

The 44th Amendment Act, 1978, repealed Article 31 and shifted the **Right to Property** to Article 300A. The decision was made to balance individual rights with the state's need to undertake land reforms and acquire property for public purposes without constitutional constraints.

### Current Status: Article 300A

Under Article 300A:  
> No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.

The **Right to Property** is now a legal right rather than a fundamental right, meaning it can be regulated or restricted by ordinary legislation.

## Importance of the Change

**1. Facilitating Land Reforms:**  
The repeal allowed the government to implement land reforms and redistribution without the need for compensation mandates that could hinder public interest projects.

**2. Redefining Property Rights:**  
While property rights are still protected under Article 300A, they no longer hold the status of inviolable fundamental rights.

## Example

### Case Study: **Land Acquisition for Public Projects**

Under Article 31, property owners could challenge the government's compensation or acquisition process in court. After its repeal and under Article 300A, such cases are now adjudicated based on the lawfulness of the acquisition process rather than a fundamental rights violation.
