# Article 51A(d) of the Constitution of India

Article 51A of the Constitution of India lays down the **Fundamental Duties** of every citizen. Clause (d) states:

> "It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so."

## Importance of Article 51A(d)

**1. Promotes Patriotism:**  
This duty instills a sense of patriotism and responsibility towards the nation, encouraging citizens to actively participate in the defense and welfare of the country.

**2. Ensures National Security:**  
By mandating citizens to defend the country, this provision reinforces collective responsibility in ensuring the nation's security during times of threat.

## Applicability

Article 51A(d) applies to all **citizens of India**, emphasizing their role in safeguarding the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of the nation. It underscores the idea that national defense is not just the responsibility of the armed forces but a collective obligation.

### Key Aspects:

* **Voluntary Service:**  
  While mandatory service is rare, the duty envisions citizens voluntarily stepping up during crises like wars, natural disasters, or other emergencies.

* **Civic Responsibility:**  
  Beyond military defense, this duty extends to actions that contribute to the nation's overall security and stability, such as supporting government initiatives during emergencies.

## Example

### Citizen Participation in National Defense

Citizens have demonstrated the spirit of Article 51A(d) in various instances. For example:

* **Example:**  
  During the Kargil War in 1999, citizens across the country contributed in various ways, including financial support, relief supplies, and voluntary service.

## Judicial Reference

The judiciary has often highlighted the relevance of Fundamental Duties in fostering a sense of responsibility among citizens. Although not enforceable by law, these duties serve as moral and ethical obligations.

* **Case Study:**  
  In **AIIMS Students Union v. AIIMS (2001)**, the Supreme Court emphasized that Fundamental Duties, though not legally enforceable, are integral to maintaining the spirit of the Constitution.
