# Article 26 of the Constitution of India

Article 26 of the Constitution of India guarantees the **freedom to manage religious affairs**. According to Article 26:

> Subject to public order, morality, and health, every religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the rightâ€”  
> (a) to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes;  
> (b) to manage its own affairs in matters of religion;  
> (c) to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and  
> (d) to administer such property in accordance with law.

## Importance of Article 26

**1. Religious Autonomy:** Article 26 safeguards the autonomy of religious denominations, allowing them to independently manage their affairs without undue interference from the State, subject to reasonable restrictions.

**2. Protection of Institutions:** This provision ensures that religious groups can establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes.

**3. Right to Property:** It also protects the right of religious denominations to own and administer property, ensuring continuity of religious and charitable activities.

## Example

### Case Study: **Religious Property Management**

Article 26 has been pivotal in cases involving the management of temples, mosques, and other religious institutions. For instance:

* **Temple Administration:** Religious denominations retain the right to manage the internal religious affairs of temples, including rituals and ceremonies. However, the State may regulate secular aspects like the management of funds to ensure transparency.

* **Legal Challenges:** Article 26 has been cited in various cases where State intervention in religious matters, such as appointing temple trustees or regulating property, was contested.

### Note:

The rights under Article 26 are not absolute and can be restricted in the interest of **public order, morality, and health**. This ensures a balance between religious freedom and societal welfare.
