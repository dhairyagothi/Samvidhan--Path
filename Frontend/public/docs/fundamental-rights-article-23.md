# **Article 23: Prohibition of Forced Labour and Traffic in Human Beings**

Article 23 of the Indian Constitution prohibits trafficking in human beings and forced labor in any form. This article aims to uphold human dignity and prevent exploitation by ensuring that no individual is forced into labor or sold as a commodity.

> "Traffic in human beings and forced labour are prohibited and any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law."

### **Key Provisions**

## **1. Prohibition of Forced Labour**

### **Explanation**:
Article 23(1) prohibits forced labor, which includes any work or service that is exacted from a person against their will. Forced labor is considered a violation of human rights, and this provision seeks to eliminate exploitation in the form of bonded labor, child labor, and human trafficking.

### **Example**:
The practice of **bonded labor**, where individuals are forced to work in exchange for a loan or debt, was widespread in India for many years. However, under Article 23, bonded labor has been declared illegal, and legislation such as the **Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976** was enacted to eradicate this practice.

## **2. Prohibition of Human Trafficking**

### **Explanation**:
Article 23(1) also specifically prohibits human trafficking, which involves the trade of individuals for exploitative purposes, such as prostitution, forced labor, or slavery. The Constitution treats trafficking as an offense punishable under law, aiming to protect individuals from being treated as commodities.

### **Example**:
In cases such as **Gaurav Jain v. Union of India (1997)**, the Supreme Court emphasized that the state must take stringent measures to prevent human trafficking for purposes of prostitution, and the law must ensure protection for victims of trafficking.

## **3. Exceptions for Voluntary Work**

### **Explanation**:
Article 23 does not prohibit voluntary work or work performed under legal obligations such as community service or prison labor. It only addresses work or service that is extracted under duress, coercion, or exploitation.

### **Example**:
The **Employment of Prisoners Act, 1850** allows for the employment of prisoners for productive work, provided that they are paid and treated with dignity. This form of labor is not considered forced labor under Article 23.

### **Importance of Article 23**

Article 23 plays a critical role in combating exploitation, particularly in the form of forced labor and human trafficking. By prohibiting such practices, the Constitution seeks to promote **human dignity** and ensure that individuals are not treated as mere commodities or forced into servitude.
