## **1. Right to Life**

### **Explanation**:
The **right to life** under Article 21 is not limited to mere existence but includes the right to live with dignity and access to the basic necessities required for a fulfilling life. The **right to life** has evolved through judicial interpretations and now encompasses a variety of rights beyond the simple protection from deprivation of life.

### **Theoretical Basis**:
The right to life can be seen as an **inherent human right** that ensures that every individual has the opportunity to lead a life of dignity and self-respect. The interpretation of this right has been continuously broadened to cover several basic needs, as well as newer rights essential for a decent life.

### **Examples**:
1. **Right to a Clean Environment**:  
   In the landmark case of **Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar (1991)**, the Supreme Court held that the right to life includes the right to a healthy environment. The court observed that the right to live in a pollution-free environment is integral to the right to life, thereby expanding the scope of Article 21.

2. **Right to Education**:  
   In **Unnikrishnan J.P. v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1993)**, the Supreme Court interpreted that the right to life includes the right to education, holding that education up to the age of 14 years is a fundamental right. This ruling further strengthened the connection between **life with dignity** and the availability of education.

3. **Right to Healthcare**:  
   In **State of Punjab v. Mohinder Singh Chawla (1997)**, the court ruled that the state has an obligation to provide adequate healthcare services, as the right to life encompasses the right to health and medical care. This interpretation reflects the broader understanding of life that extends beyond mere survival.

## **2. Personal Liberty**

### **Explanation**:
The **right to personal liberty** is a fundamental aspect of individual freedom, protecting citizens from unlawful detention, arrest, and imprisonment. It ensures that the state cannot infringe on a person’s liberty without following due legal procedures.

Personal liberty also includes **freedom of movement**, **freedom of association**, and the freedom to engage in activities that do not harm others or the public order. This provision is central to protecting the autonomy and dignity of an individual.

### **Theoretical Basis**:
The right to personal liberty draws from the idea that every individual has the inherent right to make decisions regarding their life, free from arbitrary or unjust restrictions. It safeguards an individual’s freedom to choose their actions, interact with others, and live according to their personal beliefs, as long as it does not conflict with the rights of others or societal norms.

### **Examples**:
1. **Protection Against Unlawful Detention**:  
   In the **Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978)** case, the Supreme Court held that the right to personal liberty is not only about protection from physical confinement but also includes protection from arbitrary restrictions on personal freedom. The judgment stressed that no individual can be deprived of their personal liberty unless it is done according to the **procedure established by law**.

2. **Right to Travel Abroad**:  
   The right to travel abroad was affirmed in **Satwant Singh Sawhney v. D.R. Kohli (1967)**, where the Supreme Court ruled that an individual’s right to leave the country is part of their personal liberty. The court also emphasized that a person can only be restricted from traveling abroad through a procedure laid out by law.

3. **Protection Against Arbitrary Arrest**:  
   In **D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal (1997)**, the Supreme Court issued guidelines to prevent custodial torture and unnecessary arrests. The Court observed that personal liberty should not be compromised by unjustified police actions, and individuals must be informed of their rights if arrested.

## **Expansion of Article 21: Judicial Interpretations**

Over the years, the Supreme Court of India has expanded the scope of **Article 21**, interpreting it to include several other rights that are essential for the realization of a dignified life. The judiciary has been instrumental in ensuring that the **right to life** is not limited to mere survival but extends to a broader understanding of human dignity.

### **Key Judicial Developments**:

1. **Right to Livelihood**:  
   The **right to livelihood** has been recognized as a part of the right to life in **Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation (1985)**, where the Court held that the right to life cannot be separated from the right to livelihood. Thus, an individual’s right to earn a living, especially for the poor and marginalized, is protected under Article 21.

2. **Right to Privacy**:  
   The **right to privacy** was also derived from Article 21. In **K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017)**, the Supreme Court declared that the right to privacy is a fundamental right protected under Article 21, marking a significant development in the interpretation of personal liberty.

3. **Right to Fair Treatment in Custody**:  
   The **right to be treated with dignity** in detention or custodial situations is another important extension of Article 21. In **Reinforcement of the Right to Life, Custodial Deaths (2017)**, the Court ruled that the authorities must adhere to the principles of natural justice and cannot deprive any individual of their basic dignity.
