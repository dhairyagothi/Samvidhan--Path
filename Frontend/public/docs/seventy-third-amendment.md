   - Ensured a uniform structure for rural local governance across the country.

2. **Reservation of Seats:**  
   - Provided for the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and women (not less than one-third of the total seats) in Panchayats at all levels.

3. **Regular Elections:**  
   - Ensured that Panchayat elections are conducted every five years.  
   - Mandated the constitution of a State Election Commission to oversee elections.
