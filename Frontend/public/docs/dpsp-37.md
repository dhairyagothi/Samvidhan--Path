Article 37 of the Constitution of India explains the **Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP)**. It emphasizes that while these principles are fundamental in the governance of the country, they are not enforceable by any court.

## Text of Article 37

> "The provisions contained in this Part shall not be enforceable by any court, but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws."

## Key Features of Article 37

1. **Non-Justiciable Nature:**  
   The DPSPs cannot be enforced through the judiciary. This is in contrast to Fundamental Rights, which are enforceable by courts.

2. **Fundamental in Governance:**  
   Despite being non-justiciable, the principles under DPSPs serve as guidelines for the State to frame laws and policies aimed at ensuring socio-economic justice and equality.

3. **Moral and Political Obligation:**  
   Article 37 places a moral obligation on the State to strive toward achieving the goals enshrined in the DPSPs. These goals include ensuring adequate means of livelihood, reducing inequalities, and promoting social welfare.

### Judicial Observations on DPSPs

While Article 37 declares DPSPs non-justiciable, the judiciary has often highlighted their significance:

* **Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980):**  
  The Supreme Court stated that DPSPs, together with Fundamental Rights, form the conscience of the Constitution.

* **Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973):**  
  The Court held that DPSPs are not subordinate to Fundamental Rights and should be harmonized in governance.
