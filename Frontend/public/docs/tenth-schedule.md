# Tenth Schedule of the Constitution of India

The **Tenth Schedule** of the Constitution of India, also known as the **Anti-Defection Law**, outlines the provisions for disqualification of members of Parliament and State Legislatures on the grounds of defection. It seeks to ensure stability in elected bodies by preventing elected representatives from switching parties.

## Structure of the Tenth Schedule

1. **Grounds for Disqualification:**  
   A member of Parliament or a State Legislature may be disqualified if they defect from the party on whose ticket they were elected. This includes voluntarily giving up membership of the party, or joining another party.

2. **Exceptions to Disqualification:**  
   A member is not disqualified if they are expelled from their party or if they leave the party due to a merger with another party.

3. **Disqualification Decision:**  
   The decision on whether a member has defied party discipline is made by the Chairman or Speaker of the respective house, based on the recommendation of a duly constituted authority.

4. **Mergers and Splits:**  
   The Tenth Schedule allows for exceptions in the case of a merger of political parties. A member will not be disqualified if their party merges with another, provided that at least two-thirds of the members agree to the merger.

## Importance of the Tenth Schedule

1. **Prevention of Political Instability:**  
   The Tenth Schedule aims to prevent political instability by discouraging elected representatives from frequently changing party allegiance after elections, which can lead to shifts in government power.

2. **Promotes Accountability:**  
   It encourages members to remain accountable to the party under whose banner they were elected, promoting consistency in political representation.

3. **Strengthening Democratic Institutions:**  
   By reducing defections, the Tenth Schedule aims to strengthen the democratic process and ensure that the will of the electorate is respected.

## Example of Application

1. **Defections and Disqualification:**  
   In several instances, legislators have been disqualified for defecting from their parties, especially when they joined rival parties after elections.

2. **Party Merger:**  
   The Tenth Schedule has been invoked in cases of party mergers where groups of legislators joined a new party, but remained protected from disqualification under the Scheduleâ€™s provisions.
