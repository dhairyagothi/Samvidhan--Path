# First Schedule of the Constitution of India

The **First Schedule** of the Constitution of India details the territories of India, including the States and Union Territories. It serves as a reference for the geographical boundaries and administrative divisions of the country.

## Structure of the First Schedule

The First Schedule consists of two main parts:

1. **Part A:** Contains the names and details of the States in India.
2. **Part B:** Contains the names and details of the Union Territories in India.

### Key Provisions

1. **List of States:**  
   It includes the names and territories of all Indian States, along with any modifications made over time through constitutional amendments or State reorganizations.

2. **List of Union Territories:**  
   It specifies the Union Territories, which are under the direct administrative control of the Central Government.

3. **Territorial Changes:**  
   The First Schedule is subject to changes through legislation or constitutional amendments. For instance, the reorganization of States, the creation of new States, or the conversion of a Union Territory into a State requires an update to this schedule.

## Importance of the First Schedule

1. **Defines India's Federal Structure:**  
   By clearly demarcating the territories of States and Union Territories, the First Schedule reinforces the federal structure of the Indian polity.

2. **Legal Framework for Governance:**  
   It provides a foundation for the legal and administrative governance of India's territories.

3. **Flexibility for Territorial Changes:**  
   The provision allows the Parliament to make changes to State or Union Territory boundaries, ensuring adaptability to evolving political, administrative, or regional needs.

## Examples of Territorial Changes

1. **Creation of Telangana (2014):**  
   The formation of Telangana as a separate State from Andhra Pradesh required amendments to the First Schedule.

2. **Reorganization of Jammu and Kashmir (2019):**  
   The erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two Union Territories: Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.
