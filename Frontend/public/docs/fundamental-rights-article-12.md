# Article 12 of the Constitution of India

Article 12 of the Constitution of India defines the term **"State"** for the purposes of Part III (Fundamental Rights) of the Constitution. According to Article 12:

> In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires, the State includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.

## Importance of Article 12

**1. Scope of Fundamental Rights:**  Article 12 establishes the scope of Part III (Fundamental Rights) by clearly outlining the entities against which these rights can be enforced. This ensures that individuals have legal recourse if their fundamental rights are violated by any of the entities included in the definition of "State" under Article 12.

**2. Applicability:**  The broad definition of "State" in Article 12 encompasses the following:

* **Central and State Governments:** This includes all branches of the government, both at the central and state level, such as the executive, legislature, and judiciary (in its administrative capacity).
* **Local Authorities:** This category includes bodies like Municipal Corporations, Panchayats, and other local governing bodies responsible for specific areas or functions.
* **Bodies under the control of the Government of India:**  This includes various public sector undertakings, institutions, and organizations established or controlled by the central government.

## Example

### Case Study: **State vs Private Entity**

Article 12 helps differentiate between violations by the "State" and those by private entities. It ensures that your fundamental rights are protected against actions taken by entities falling under the definition of "State."


* **Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs):** If a PSU infringes upon your fundamental rights, Article 12 allows you to seek legal recourse as a PSU is considered part of the "State" under this provision.
* **Government-controlled Institutions:** Similar to PSUs, any violation of fundamental rights by a government-controlled institution can be challenged using Article 12.

### Note:

The judiciary, when acting in its judicial capacity, is **not included** under the definition of "State." However, when it functions in an administrative capacity, it may be considered as part of the "State" for the purpose of enforcing fundamental rights.
