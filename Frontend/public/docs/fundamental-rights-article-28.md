# Article 28 of the Constitution of India

Article 28 of the Constitution of India deals with the **freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in certain educational institutions**. According to Article 28:

> (1) No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds.  
> (2) Nothing in clause (1) shall apply to an educational institution which is administered by the State but has been established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious instruction shall be imparted in such institution.  
> (3) No person attending any educational institution recognized by the State or receiving aid out of State funds shall be required to take part in any religious instruction or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution or premises without their consent, or, if they are a minor, without the consent of their guardian.

## Importance of Article 28

**1. Secular Character of State Education:**  
Article 28 ensures that state-funded educational institutions do not impose religious instruction, maintaining the secular nature of education.

**2. Respect for Individual Freedom:**  
It protects students from being compelled to participate in religious instruction or worship, respecting their personal beliefs and freedom of choice.

**3. Exceptions for Endowments and Trusts:**  
Educational institutions established under specific endowments or trusts requiring religious instruction are exempt from the general prohibition, allowing them to honor the objectives of their founders.

## Example

### Case Study: **Religious Instruction in Schools**

* **Government Schools:**  
  Schools wholly funded by the government cannot impart religious instruction to maintain a clear separation between religion and state.

* **Trust-based Institutions:**  
  If a school is administered by the state but established through a trust requiring religious instruction, such instruction is permitted as an exception under Article 28(2).

* **Consent Requirement:**  
  No student can be forced to attend religious instruction or worship in any recognized or state-aided school. For minors, the guardian's consent is necessary.

### Note:

The provisions of Article 28 ensure a balance between secularism and cultural diversity, allowing religious instruction in specific contexts while safeguarding individual freedoms.
