### 2. **Access to Public Places:**  
   Clause (2) specifically ensures that individuals cannot be denied access to public spaces and amenities, such as shops, restaurants, and roads, based on discriminatory grounds.

### 3. **Positive Discrimination (Affirmative Action):**

## Judicial Interpretation

### **1. State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan (1951):**  
   The Supreme Court ruled that communal reservations in government jobs and educational institutions violated Article 15(1). This led to the First Constitutional Amendment, allowing special provisions for backward classes under Article 15(4).

### **2. Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992):**  
   The Court upheld the validity of reservations for socially and educationally backward classes in public services but emphasized that caste cannot be the sole determinant of backwardness.

### **3. Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India (2008):**  
   The Supreme Court upheld the 93rd Constitutional Amendment, which allowed reservations for OBCs in educational institutions, including private institutions, under Article 15(5).

## Examples

### Case Study 1: **Reservation for Women in Public Transport**  
   Many states provide reserved seats for women in buses and trains under Article 15(3). This ensures their safety and equitable access to public transport.

### Case Study 2: **Reservation in Education**  
   Policies reserving seats for SC, ST, and OBC candidates in educational institutions are examples of affirmative action under Article 15(4) and 15(5). For instance, the government mandates that 27% of seats in centrally funded educational institutions be reserved for OBCs.

### Case Study 3: **Access to Public Amenities**  
   Denying access to a public park or temple on grounds of caste would directly violate Article 15(2). Such actions can be challenged in court to uphold the principle of equality.
