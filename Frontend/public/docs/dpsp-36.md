# Article 36: Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP)

Article 36 of the Indian Constitution is the opening article of Part IV, which deals with the **Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP)**. It provides the definition of the term "State" for the purpose of applying the provisions in Part IV.

## Text of Article 36

*"In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires, 'the State' has the same meaning as in Part III."*

## Explanation of Article 36

Article 36 clarifies that the definition of "State" for Directive Principles is identical to the definition provided in **Article 12** under Part III (Fundamental Rights). This includes:

- **Government and Parliament of India** (the central government),
- **Government and Legislature of States** (state governments),
- **Local Authorities** (municipalities, panchayats, etc.),
- **Other Authorities** under the control of the Government of India.

Thus, any principles under the DPSP are applicable to these entities, guiding their policies and actions.

## Importance of Article 36 in DPSP

1. **Framework for Governance:**  
   By linking to the definition of "State," Article 36 ensures that all government bodies are obligated to strive towards implementing the Directive Principles in their policies.

2. **Foundation for Socioeconomic Justice:**  
   Article 36 reinforces the responsibility of the State to work for the welfare of the people by providing a framework for establishing social and economic democracy.

## Example of Application

The **Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017**, which enhanced maternity leave for working women, is an example of the government adhering to the Directive Principles outlined in **Article 39(e)** and **Article 42**. Article 36 ensures that such principles guide the "State" in promoting the welfare of its citizens.

## Relationship with Fundamental Rights

While Fundamental Rights (Part III) are enforceable in courts, the Directive Principles (Part IV) are **non-justiciable**. However, Article 36 ensures that all State actions in implementing DPSP align with their constitutional role defined in Part III.
